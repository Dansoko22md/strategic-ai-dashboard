A sophisticated intelligence gathering and analysis system that automatically identifies, ranks, and analyzes the most strategically important AI developments from across the web. Built for executives, researchers, and strategists who need to stay ahead of the AI curve.

## 🎯 Core Value Proposition

Unlike traditional news aggregators, this dashboard doesn't just collect AI news—it **thinks strategically**. Using advanced LLM analysis, it:

- **Identifies** what actually matters vs. mere hype
- **Connects** seemingly unrelated developments into strategic threads  
- **Predicts** implications and next moves
- **Ranks** stories by true strategic importance, not just popularity

## 🚀 Key Features

### 📊 Executive Dashboard
- **Strategic Scoring**: Each story rated on Impact, Timing, Players, and Precedent
- **Priority Classification**: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW with clear reasoning
- **Executive Summaries**: One-paragraph strategic takeaways
- **Source Diversity**: arXiv, GitHub, HackerNews, TechCrunch, and more

### 🧠 AI-Powered Analysis Engine
- **Category Classification**: Model releases, regulatory changes, funding moves, research breakthroughs
- **Strategic Connections**: Identifies how stories relate (responses, enablers, competition)
- **Power Dynamics**: Tracks shifting competitive landscapes
- **Trend Detection**: Surfaces emerging patterns before they become obvious

### 🔗 Strategic Threads View
- **Connection Mapping**: Visual representation of how developments interconnect
- **Response Tracking**: Identifies competitive moves and counter-moves
- **Enabling Relationships**: Shows what developments make others possible

### 📈 Deep Analysis
- **Power Shift Analysis**: Understanding changing competitive dynamics
- **Trend Identification**: Emerging patterns across the AI landscape
- **Intelligence Breakdown**: Category-wise distribution of developments

## 🏗️ Architecture
